# Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a supermarket database, providing insights into various aspects of business operations, including customer behavior, payment methods, and product performance. Below are key analysis tasks performed on the supermarket dataset.

## Overview

The supermarket database contains transactional data, including details on:

- **Sales Transactions**: Data related to each sale, such as date, total amount, and payment method.
- **Products**: Information about product lines, quantities sold, and gross income.
- **Customer Ratings**: Feedback and ratings provided by customers for their purchases.
- **Branches**: Multiple branches of the supermarket, including their gross income and performance.

## Key Analysis Tasks

### 1. **Count the Number of Occurrences of Each City**
This analysis focuses on how frequently each city appears in the supermarket database. The objective is to understand which cities contribute most to the supermarket's business and presence.

### 2. **Find the Most Frequently Used Payment Method**
This task identifies the most popular payment method used by customers in supermarket transactions. Understanding this can help in making business decisions related to payment systems, promotions, or infrastructure.

### 3. **Analyze the Impact of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) on Customer Ratings**
This analysis explores the relationship between the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and customer ratings. The goal is to identify whether higher costs correlate with higher or lower ratings from customers, potentially indicating how pricing influences customer satisfaction.

### 4. **Identify the Most Profitable Branch by Gross Income**
Here, we analyze the total gross income per branch, which helps in identifying the branch that generates the highest revenue. This insight can help in targeting resources, marketing, or business strategy to enhance branch performance.

### 5. **Find the Most Used Payment Method City-Wise**
This analysis looks at payment methods across different cities, helping to understand regional preferences. This information is useful for tailoring promotional campaigns or adapting payment systems based on regional trends.

### 6. **Identify the Product Line with the Highest Quantity Sold**
This analysis identifies the product line that has the highest total sales volume, providing insights into customer preferences and inventory management. This can help in optimizing stock levels or promotions for top-selling product lines.

### 7. **Display Daily Sales by Day of the Week**
This query analyzes sales based on the day of the week, showing which days tend to generate the highest sales. Such data can be valuable for staffing, planning, and promotional activities targeting specific days.

### 8. **Find the Month with the Highest Sales**
This query shows which month generates the highest total sales, offering insights into seasonal trends, demand patterns, and opportunities for business growth in particular months.
